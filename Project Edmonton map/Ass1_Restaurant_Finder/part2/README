# Assignment #1: Restaurant Finder part 2
# -----------------------------------------

Included Files :
    * a1part2.cpp
    * restaurant.cpp
    * restaurant.h
    * lcd_image.cpp
    * lcd_image.h
    * yegmap.cpp
    * yegmap.h
    * README
    * Makefile

Accessories:
    * Arduino Mega 2560 Board ( AMG )
    * 1 tft display
    * 1 SD card
    * 1 joystick
    * 1 Breadboard

Wiring instructions :
    * Insert the tft display shield with the correct direction
    * Arduino analog pin A8 should connect to joystick VRy
    * Arduino analog pin A9 should connect to joystick VRx
    * Arduino digital pin 53 should connect to joystick pin SW
    * Arduino +5V should connect to joystick +5V
    * Arduino GND should connect to joystick GND

Running Instructions :
    1. Connect the Arduino to the PC using an A - B style USB cable . Ensure
that the Arduino is using the proper serial port (/ dev / ttyACM0 or - ACM1 )
    2. In the directory containing the files , use the command "make upload" to
upload the code to the Arduino.

Makefile Targets :
    * make upload : Builds the project and upload the code to the Arduino.
    * make clean : Removes all object files and executable.
    * make help : Prints a list of targets and the purpose of each.

Note:
    The files below are the files from e-class:
        * lcd_image.cpp
        * lcd_image.h
        * restaurant.cpp
        * restaurant.h
        * yegmap.cpp
        * yegmap.h

Contains added/modified functions(a1part2.cpp):

    Function beginMode0():(from e-class) Set the mode to 0 and draw the map, cursor and buttons
        according to curView

    Function beginMode1():(from e-class) Sort the restaurants around the cursor and then display
        the list, and there are three modes: quickSort, insertionSort and both.

    Function buttonDisplay(): Draw the two buttons and their borders.

    Function starDisplay(): Display the number of stars.

    Function sortDisplay(): Display the sorting mode.

    Function scrollingMap():(from e-class) Process joystick and touchscreen input when in mode 0.
         The joystick has movement and click operations, and the touchscreen input can be buttons
         or drawing dots.

    Function scrollingMenu():(from e-class) Process joystick movement when in mode 1.
        Display the list of restaurants that have the corresponding number of stars by pages.
        Each page displays 21 restaurants.

    The functions from e-class without change (a1part2.cpp):
        * setup()
        * moveCursor()
        * printRestaurant(int i)

Contains added/modified functions(restaurant.cpp):

    Function insertionSort(RestDist restaurants[], int num):
        Insertion sort to sort the restaurants.
        "num" is the number of restaurants to be sorted.

    Function partition(RestDist restaurant[], int begin, int end):
        When using quick sort, find the pivot and return it.

    Function quickSort(RestDist restaurant[], int begin, int end):
        Quick sort to sort the restaurants.

    Function getAndInsertSortRestaurants(const MapView &mv, RestDist restaurants[],
                            Sd2Card *card, RestCache *cache, int star, int &num):
        Get restaurants that have the corresponding number of stars
        and use insertion sort to sort the restaurant array by distance.

    Function getAndQuickSortRestaurants(const MapView &mv, RestDist restaurants[],
                            Sd2Card *card, RestCache *cache, int star, int &num):
        Get restaurants that have the corresponding number of stars
        and use insertion sort to sort the restaurant array by distance.

    The functions from e-class without change (restaurant.cpp):
        * getRestaurant(restaurant *ptr, int i, Sd2Card *card, RestCache *cache)
        * swap(RestDist &r1, RestDist &r2)
        * manhattan(int16_t x1, int16_t y1, int16_t x2, int16_t y2)
